The files in `/scripts/Documentation/` define and give shape to various global tables and objects otherwise unavailable outside of the game, using the [official skinning documentation](https://unnamed-sdvx-clone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as reference. These definitions enable autocompletion, function signatures, hover hints, etc. when using this [Lua extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua). This is entirely for skin development purposes and has no effect on skin performance or functionality.
